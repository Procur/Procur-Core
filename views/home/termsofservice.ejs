      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>

      <p>This is the Privacy Policy governing your use of the Procur.com site (the "Site") and the collection, use, transfer and processing of Collected Content by Procur Systems, LLC and our affiliates (collectively referred to as "Procur.com", "we" or "us"). By using this Site, you consent to our Privacy Policy set out below. All terms not defined in this document have the meanings ascribed to them in the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use Agreement</a> between you and Procur.com which, by use of this Site, you agree to accept.</p>

      <h2>1. Collected Information and Content</h2>
      <p><b>Background.</b> Procur Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Procur," “our,” “us,” or "we"), provides a proprietary service, including a web-based portal (the “Service”) that is designed to connect buyers (“Buyers”) and suppliers (“Suppliers”) of wholesale products (“Products”). Buyers and Suppliers who use the Service are referred to as “Users” in this document. To be clear, Procur is not directly involved in the transaction between Buyers and Suppliers, and the Service does not include the provision or acquisition of Products themselves – we are a technology and marketplace provider, not a buyer or supplier of Products.</p></br></br>
      <p><b>Acceptance.</b> This terms of service agreement ("<b>Agreement</b>") sets forth the legally binding terms between Procur, you (“<b>you</b>”) and your employer or other organization (the “</b>Company</b>”) regarding the Service, whether as a Supplier or a Buyer, as the case may be.  The “<b>SUPPLIERS</b>” section below applies to the Company only insofar as the Company uses the Service as a Supplier. The “<b>BUYERS</b>” section applies only insofar as the Company uses the Service as a Buyer. And the “<b>ALL USERS</b>” section applies to all Users. All references to “you” in this Agreement apply equally to the Company.</p></br></br>
      <p>By clicking the “<b>I AGREE</b>” button, you agree on behalf of the Company, effective as of such date (the “<b>Effective Date</b>”), to be bound by this Agreement. Our privacy policy (“<b>Privacy Policy</b>”) is hereby incorporated by reference into this Agreement.  You also agree individually and on behalf of the Company to our Privacy Policy and consent to the practices concerning data collection, transmission and use set forth therein. Please read this Agreement carefully and save it. If you do not agree with it, you should discontinue use of the Service immediately. </p></br></br>
      <p><b>Representations.</b>  You represent that you are the authorized agent of the Company and have the legal authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf of the Company. You also represent that (a) you have read and understand this Agreement, (b) you are 18 years of age or older, and (c) you have obtained all consents and permissions necessary to share the information you provide to us in connection with the Service and the information that you provide to us about the Company will be current, true, accurate, supportable and complete. </p>
      <h2>TERMS APPLICABLE ONLY TO SUPPLIERS</h2>
      <p><b>Conditions of Supplier Eligibility.</b>  In order to qualify as a Supplier, the Company must (i) provide us with certain required information, (ii) be authorized to conduct business in the applicable jurisdiction, and (iii) maintain any required licenses, permits and registrations applicable to the Company’s industry or jurisdiction.  If Procur has previously removed the Company as a Supplier or terminated any account associated with the Company, the Company is not eligible to become a Supplier via this Agreement.</p></br></br>
      <p><b>Supplier Promises.</b>  As a Supplier, you agree to comply with this Agreement and all applicable law at all times. Supplier is solely responsible for ensuring that it meets any requirements imposed by a Buyer with whom it transacts business via the Service.</p></br></br>
      <p><b>Supplier Acknowledgements.</b> Suppler acknowledges that nothing in this Agreement, and no transaction conducted through the Service, shall in any way be construed to establish Supplier as an agent, employee or representative of Procur.  Procur merely provides a technology-enabled service to Supplier.  Supplier agrees to furnish all facilities, equipment, tools and materials necessary to undertake its obligations and responsibilities, and shall incur all expenses associated with Supplier’s provision of Products. It is the sole responsibility of Supplier to ascertain its appropriate and desired level of insurance. Supplier acknowledges that Procur is not responsible for and shall not be liable for actions taken or promises made by Buyers. Supplier accepts all risks related to interacting with and transacting with Buyers. </p></br></br>
      <p><b>Membership Types.</b> We offer all Suppliers access to certain features of the Service under a basic user account (“<b>Basic Membership</b>”). Suppliers may also upgrade their account, after the Early Access Period (defined below), to a premium membership (“<b>Premium Membership</b>”) that, in exchange for a monthly subscription fee, permits Suppliers to list Products and pricing terms, accept requests for quotations (RFQs) from Buyers, increase their visibility, and more.   </p></br></br>
      <p><b>Payment Terms.</b> There is currently no fee for Basic Memberships.  Fees for Premium Memberships are available here. We offer Suppliers that subscribe to Premium Memberships the option of choosing monthly, 12-month or 24-month subscription terms.  All subscription fees are due prior to the start of the applicable subscription term.  All fees are due and payable in U.S. dollars, non-refundable (except to the extent set </p></br></br>
      <p><b>Premium Membership Subscription Terms.</b>  Upon receipt of payment for the Premium Membership and subject to your adherence to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, we will make the premium features of the Service available to Supplier during the applicable subscription period.  The foregoing does not diminish our ability to terminate Supplier’s account (without refund) in the event of a breach of the Agreement, or for our convenience. If we terminate this Agreement for our convenience during the term of a paid subscription, we will refund a pro rata portion of the subscription fee.</p></br></br>
      <p>Procur uses Stripe as its third party service provider for payment services (e.g. card acceptance, merchant settlement, and related services). By purchasing a subscription to a Premium Membership, you agree to be bound by Stripe’s Privacy Policy (https://stripe.com/us/privacy) and further consent and authorize Procur and Stripe to share any information and payments instructions you provide with other third party service provider(s) to the minimum extent required to complete your transactions.</p></br></br>
      <p><b>Taxes.</b> Supplier acknowledges and agrees that Supplier is obligated to report as income all compensation received by Supplier pursuant to transactions commissioned via the Service, and is solely responsible for paying all self-employment and other taxes thereon.  Supplier further acknowledges that states, cities or other applicable jurisdictions may impose taxes or surcharges related to Supplier’s transactions with Buyers. Because Procur merely provides a service to facilitate transactions between Suppliers and Buyers, is not a party to your agreement with the Buyer, Supplier is solely responsible for determining whether any such tax or charge is applicable, calculating the same and remitting it to the applicable authority, and adjusting the amounts that you impose upon Buyers accordingly, to the extent you want the Buyers to bear or share the burden of an such amount. Supplier agrees to indemnify Procur and hold Procur harmless from any claim relating to any such tax or charge.</p></br></br>
      <p><b>Early Access Period.</b>  Certain aspects of the Service may be made available to you in beta form prior to Procur making the Service generally available to other Users (“Early Access Period”). You acknowledge that Procur has no obligation to provide a production version of the Service after the Early Access Period, and that should such a production version be made available, it may have features or functionality different from those available during the Early Access Period. In addition to the disclaimers of warranty set out in this Agreement, you expressly acknowledge and agree that all use of the Service during the Early Access Period is at your sole risk. </p>
      <h2>TERMS APPLICABLE ONLY TO BUYERS</h2>
      <p><b>Conditions of Buyer Eligibility.</b> In order to qualify as a Buyer, the Company must (i) provide us with certain required information, (ii) be authorized to conduct business in the applicable jurisdiction, and (iii) maintain any required licenses, permits and registrations applicable to the Company’s industry or jurisdiction.  If Procur has previously removed the Company as a Buyer or terminated any account associated with the Company, the Company is not eligible to become a Supplier via this Agreement.</p></br></br>
      <p><b>Buyer Promises.</b> As a Buyer, you will (i) conduct transactions at all times in accordance with this Agreement, (ii) pay for any Products ordered from a Supplier, and (iii) comply with all applicable law at all times. Buyer is solely responsible for ensuring that it meets requirements imposed by any Seller with which it transacts business via the Service. </p></br></br>
      <p><b>Buyer Acknowledgements.</b> Buyer acknowledges that each Supplier is, vis-à-vis Procur, an independent contractor, and that Procur has no responsibility and makes no guarantees regarding Suppliers or Products. Suppliers are solely responsible for all aspects of any Products ordered. We make no guarantees regarding the fees, terms, or services offered or made available by Suppliers or that any Supplier will fulfill any Product ordered. Procur does not guarantee that quotes, prices, terms, or Products offered by Suppliers are the best available. Buyer solely accepts all risks related to interacting with and transacting with Suppliers and that Procur shall not be liable for any losses, costs, damages or claims in connection with, arising from or related to your use of a Supplier’s Products.</p></br></br>
      <p><b>Taxes.</b> Buyer acknowledges and agrees that as between Procur and Buyer, it shall be responsible for bearing the cost of any sales or comparable taxes associated with purchases it makes from a Supplier. </p>
      <h2>TERMS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS</h2>
      <p><b>Modifications.</b> We may modify the terms of this Agreement from time to time. Any modification shall be effective when we notify you of the modification (via an update delivered through the Service or via email or other notification) and you signify your acceptance (via email or an electronic click-to-accept method).</p></br></br>
      <p><b>Supplemental Terms.</b> To enjoy certain aspects of the Service, additional terms may apply.  We will present supplemental terms and conditions for review and acceptance at the time that you undertake such activity within the Service, and any such supplemental terms (each, “<b>Supplemental Terms</b>”) shall become a part of this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms shall govern with respect to the matters contemplated thereby. <b>Terms of Purchase and Sale of Products.</b> The Service may allow Buyers and Sellers to establish certain terms and conditions of purchase and sale of Products, e.g. price, payment terms and delivery dates. Those terms and conditions, as supplemented by applicable law, will comprise the terms of purchase and sale of Products for any transaction facilitated via the Service.</p></br></br>
      <p><b>Disputes Among Users and Release of Procur.</b>  The Service is designed to create a marketplace for Products and to facilitate transactions among Suppliers and Buyers.  Procur does not provide Products, nor does it guarantee any Products, or payment therefor. EACH USER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS INTERACTIONS AND TRANSACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS OF THE SERVICE, AGREES TO LOOK SOLELY TO SUCH OTHER USERS FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGE OR LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH ANY TRANSACTION COMMISSED VIA THE SERVICE AND ANY PRODUCT, AND EXPRESSLY WAIVES AND RELEASES PROCUR FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DAMAGES AND LIABILITIES ARISING OUT OF ANY ACT OR OMISSION OF ANY SUCH USER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES RELATING TO PERSONAL INJURY OR DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY. Procur reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor disputes between Users.</p></br></br>
      <p><b>Representations About Your Information and Consent Regarding Use Information.</b>  You represent and warrant that all information that you provide in connection with the Service will be current, true, accurate, supportable and complete.  If you submit comments, suggestions, ratings, or other feedback regarding the Application, the Service, Suppliers or Buyers (“<b>Feedback</b>”), you agree that we will be free to use such Feedback for any purpose and without restriction or obligation.</p></br></br>
      <p><b>Consent to Receive Messages.</b> We may need to communicate with you about the Service, and we would like to make certain commercial offers available to you from time to time. AS SUCH, YOU CONSENT TO RECEIVE COMMERCIAL MESSAGES (WHETHER BY PHONE, EMAIL, TEXT OR PUSH NOTIFICATIONS) FROM US OR OUR THIRD PARTY PARTNERS, AND ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOUR PRIMARY PHONE NUMBERS AND EMAIL ADDRESSES AND OTHER INFORMATION MAY BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF INITIATING COMMERCIAL MESSAGES.  We will allow you to opt out of receiving commercial messages, but in order to stop receiving any messages from us whatsoever (including administrative messages regarding the Service or messages that are primarily about transactions enabled via the Service), you will need to terminate your account.</p></br></br>
