      Support for LESS included by default
      ================================================

      LESS files are automatically compiled when they change using the Gruntfile
      located in the top-level of this Sails app.  If you run into issues with styles
      not reloading, check the Sails log output in your console for LESS compilation errors.
      If necessary, shut down and then lift your app again.
